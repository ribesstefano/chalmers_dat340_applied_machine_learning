# DAT340 - Applied Machine Learning

The following are a list of topics covered in the course assignments. For each code assignment, a Colab Notebook has been written and can be found in its directory, whereas a PDF version of the notebooks can be viewed in [reports/](reports/).

## Assignment 1: Decision Trees

* Introduction to popular Sklearn models
* Decision tree implementation and evaluation
* Decision trees for regression

## Assignment 2: Random Forests

* Feature extraction and vectorization
* Underfitting and overfitting in decision tree and random forests
* Feature importance

## Assignment 3: Text Classification

* Data cleaning, tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization
* Sklearn pipeline
* ROC-AUC and confusion matrices

The assignment also includes a [written report](reports/DAT340 - Assignment 3 - Report.pdf) summarizing and discussion the models implementation.

## Assignment 4: Implementing linear classifiers

* Linear separability
* Perceptron
* Implementing a linear SVC classifier
* Implementing a Logistic Regression classifier
* Making the code more efficient
  * BLAS
  * Using sparse vectors
  * Optimal scaling ("scaling trick")

## Assignment 5: Image Classification

* CNNs for binary classification
* Data augmentation
* Applying a pre-trained convolutional neural network
* Using VGG-16 as a feature extractor
* Visualizing the learned features

## Writing Assignment 1: A graph placement methodology for fast chip design

A summary of the paper *"A graph placement methodology for fast chip design"*, by Mirhoseini et al., Nature 2021.

## Writing Assignment 2: Breaking Things is Easy

The report contains a summary and reflection on a [series of blog posts](http://www.cleverhans.io/security/privacy/ml/2016/12/16/breaking-things-is-easy.html) about the *security and privacy* of machine learning models, by Papernot and Goodfellow.
